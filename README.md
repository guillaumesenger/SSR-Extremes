# SSR-Extremes

## Overview
This repository contains scripts and notebooks related to the analysis of Surface Solar Radiation Extreme events.

## Scripts

### `my_functions`
Folder containing custom functions used across multiple notebooks and scripts.

### `my_functions_examples.ipynb`
Notebook demonstrating the usage and functionality of functions in the `my_functions` folder.

### `Get_Data_Local.py`
Script loading CMIP6 time series for a grid box containing a specific location

### `Get_PV_Power.py`
Script that computes the daily PV power generation of a specific PV installation from a daily mean SSR time series

### `Get_SREs_maps.py`
Script that generates maps that quantify the SREs occurrence for different SREs parameters based on CMIP6 piControl data.

## Notebooks

### `SSR_Overview.ipynb`
Notebook providing an overview of SSR statistics for different data sets.

### `SREs_Local_Analysis.ipynb`
